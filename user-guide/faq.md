### How do I use a specific branch or tag?

To use a specific branch or tag form your git repository, simply append the `#branch` or `#tag` to the end of your git URL. For example, to use the develop branch, you might have a URL of [`https://example.com/repos/example-repo.git#develop`](https://example.com/repos/example-repo.git#develop).
